# INVICTABYZANGANA

Are you tired of not feeling satisfied with yourself? Do you want to improve your life? Then I have the perfect solution for you!
My Full Stack Websites goal is targeted towards people that would want to have some guidance in their self-improvement journey.
Have a look down below!


Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://saninvicta.herokuapp.com



![](documentation/amiresponsive.png)

## UX

In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.

### Colour Scheme

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

- `##FAFAFA` used for primary text.
- `#000000` used as background-color

### Typography
Some fonts were used to this website, for showcasing the comments or likes on the various reviews.

- [Poppins]("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap") was used for the primary headers and titles.

## User Stories

In this section, list all of your user stories for the project.

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to be able to sign up, so that I can _interact with the community___________

- As a new site user, I would like to _easily be able to navigate through the site___________, so that I can __find the information I need__________.
### Returning Site Users

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Feature #1**

    - The home section invites the user to the goal of the site, a brief introduction is then proceeded by some of my own transformations throughout the years. This is mainly so he user can see that I lead by example!

- **Feature #2**

    - The second page includes a membership section where as a user, they can see what type of subscription is sold and what they will have access to if they decide to buy it.

    - They also have a chance to both read AND leave their own review/testimonial if they find my tips to be good. This will help both the admin of the site but also the other users to see that the tips are working.

![](documentation/membership3.png)

- **Feature #3**

    - Because the site itself is targeted towards people that would like to improve, the plan was to have some sort of way of connecting with each other. Which is exactly why the last feature, is the ability to register an account.
    After registration, the user can, as mentioned above, post their own reviews

    - The sign in feature comes with a 'sign out' option as well, of course.

### Future Features

The time constraint led to the site being a bit empty, however, in the future I would like to implement a feature for the users to comment and like the various reviews.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/SanZangana/InvictaByZangana/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SanZangana/InvictaByZangana/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

Consider adding a screenshot of your Open and Closed Issues.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: Log-in, Log-out, register feature. Leave a review, delete a review and edit a review as a user. 
- **Should Have**: Leave comments & likes on reviews

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://saninvicta.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: invictabyzangana).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.
- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | insert your own Cloudinary API key here |
| `DATABASE_URL` | insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | this can be any random secret key |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "insert your own Cloudinary API key here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "this can be any random secret key")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SanZangana/InvictaByZangana) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/SanZangana/InvictaByZangana.git`
